The motion stemmed from testimony by an LAFD arson investigator who revealed that fingerprint cards from the 2011 Kid Cudi break-in had been destroyed by the LAPD, with prosecutors questioning if this was \"unusual.\" The defense argued this improperly suggested Combs had the evidence destroyed, but the judge instructed the jury to disregard the exchange. The day also featured corroborating testimony from Cassie Ventura's former stylist, Deonte Nash, who described witnessing Combs hit Ventura's head on a bed frame, causing it to bleed, and hearing Combs threaten to release sex tapes and get her parents fired. This testimony aimed to bolster the prosecution's claims of a consistent pattern of violence and intimidation.","dataStoryPlan":"A legal process and evidence-flow diagram isst capture the day's key events. The diagram has two main branches. The first branch, \"Mistrial Motion,\" maps the sequence: LAFD testimony on destroyed fingerprints -> Prosecution's \"unusual\" question -> Defense objection and mistrial motion -> Judge's denial and instruction to the jury. This visually clarifies the legal maneuvering. The second branch, \"Corroboration of Violence,\" is a network graph connecting Deonte Nash's testimony to specific allegations made by Cassie Ventura (e.g., \"Bed Frame Incident,\" \"Sex Tape Threats\"). This visually demonstrate how the prosecution is layering witness accounts to build a cohesive and corroborated narrative of abuse for the jury.","visualizationType":"legal-process","createdAt":"$D2025-07-04T00:49:41.687Z","updatedAt":"$D2025-07-05T09:49:38.788Z","testimonies":[],"evidence":[]},"allTrialDays":[{"id":1,"trialDayNumber":1,"headlineTitle":"Trial Commences with Dueling Narratives: Prosecution Alleges Criminal Enterprise, Defense Cites \"Love and Jealousy\"","date":"$D2025-05-12T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":2,"trialDayNumber":2,"headlineTitle":"Cassie Ventura Delivers Harrowing Testimony on \"Humiliating Marathon Sex Sessions\" and Coercive Control","date":"$D2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":3,"trialDayNumber":3,"headlineTitle":"Routine Violence and Blackmail Detailed as Cassie Ventura Continues Testimony, Reveals $20M Settlement","date":"$D2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":4,"trialDayNumber":4,"headlineTitle":"Defense Cross-Examines Cassie, Portraying Aggression as Product of Jealousy and Drug Use, Not Coercion","date":"$D2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":5,"trialDayNumber":5,"headlineTitle":"Cassie Ventura Concludes Testimony Under Scrutiny of Recollections and Motives;
