The defense highlighted texts where Jane herself recruited sex workers and offered her home for \"freak offs,\" which she explained was an attempt to \"seize some level of control\" and please her lover. Attorney Teny Geragos also scrutinized Jane's finances, noting that Combs continued to pay her rent and other costs, implying a transactional element to their relationship that undermined her victim status. Jane became emotional, retorting, \"How much does my body cost?\" when questioned about a designer bag, and tearfully stated she resented Combs \"for knowing how much I loved him and knowing I couldn't say no to him,\" encapsulating the complex dynamic of affection and alleged exploitation.","dataStoryPlan":"A dynamic network graph focused on \"agency and influence\" could visualize the complex power dynamics described. Nodes would represent Jane, Combs, and the various escorts. The size of the nodes could represent perceived power or influence. The lines (edges) connecting them would represent interactions, color-coded by who initiated them (e.g., blue for Combs, pink for Jane). The visualization could be filtered by date to show how the initiation of contact for \"hotel nights\" may have shifted over time. Pop-up data on the edges would display excerpts from text messages, allowing an analyst to explore the defense's claim of Jane's agency versus her testimony that she was merely \"adapting to my circumstances.\"","visualizationType":"dynamic-network","createdAt":"$D2025-07-04T00:49:41.692Z","updatedAt":"$D2025-07-05T09:49:38.792Z","testimonies":[],"evidence":[]},"allTrialDays":[{"id":1,"trialDayNumber":1,"headlineTitle":"Trial Commences with Dueling Narratives: Prosecution Alleges Criminal Enterprise, Defense Cites \"Love and Jealousy\"","date":"$D2025-05-12T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":2,"trialDayNumber":2,"headlineTitle":"Cassie Ventura Delivers Harrowing Testimony on \"Humiliating Marathon Sex Sessions\" and Coercive Control","date":"$D2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":3,"trialDayNumber":3,"headlineTitle":"Routine Violence and Blackmail Detailed as Cassie Ventura Continues Testimony, Reveals $20M Settlement","date":"$D2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":4,"trialDayNumber":4,"headlineTitle":"Defense Cross-Examines Cassie, Portraying Aggression as Product of Jealousy and Drug Use, Not Coercion","date":"$D2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":5,"trialDayNumber":5,"headlineTitle":"Cassie Ventura Concludes Testimony Under Scrutiny of Recollections and Motives;
