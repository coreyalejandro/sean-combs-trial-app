Sobbing on the stand, Jane stated she participated against her will to make Combs happy, using drugs like ecstasy to make the experiences \"seem less real.\" She testified that these encounters, which sometimes lasted for days, frequently resulted in painful infections and that she was pressured to have unprotected sex. Jane recounted a three-day \"hotel night\" on her birthday where she asked the escorts to wear protection, which upset Combs. Her testimony aimed to establish a clear pattern of sexual coercion, where her reluctance was ignored and her physical well-being was disregarded in service of Combs's alleged fantasies.","dataStoryPlan":"A health and psychological impact tracker visualization would powerfully illustrate the toll described by \"Jane.\" This dashboard features two main components. The first is a calendar view of 2021-2024, with days marked for each alleged \"hotel night.\" Clicking on a marked day reveals details from her testimony, including duration and drug use. The second component is a body-mapping graphic of a female silhouette. Areas of the body could be highlighted (e.g., pelvic region) and linked to her testimony about physical consequences like \"frequent infections\" and \"pelvic pain 100% of the time.\" A separate section could track psychological impact, using quotes like \"disgusting, repulsed\" to create a word cloud of her emotional state, providing a holistic view of the alleged harm.","visualizationType":"health-impact","createdAt":"$D2025-07-04T00:49:41.690Z","updatedAt":"$D2025-07-05T09:49:38.791Z","testimonies":[],"evidence":[]},"allTrialDays":[{"id":1,"trialDayNumber":1,"headlineTitle":"Trial Commences with Dueling Narratives: Prosecution Alleges Criminal Enterprise, Defense Cites \"Love and Jealousy\"","date":"$D2025-05-12T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":2,"trialDayNumber":2,"headlineTitle":"Cassie Ventura Delivers Harrowing Testimony on \"Humiliating Marathon Sex Sessions\" and Coercive Control","date":"$D2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":3,"trialDayNumber":3,"headlineTitle":"Routine Violence and Blackmail Detailed as Cassie Ventura Continues Testimony, Reveals $20M Settlement","date":"$D2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":4,"trialDayNumber":4,"headlineTitle":"Defense Cross-Examines Cassie, Portraying Aggression as Product of Jealousy and Drug Use, Not Coercion","date":"$D2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z"},{"id":5,"trialDayNumber":5,"headlineTitle":"Cassie Ventura Concludes Testimony Under Scrutiny of Recollections and Motives;
